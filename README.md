# The Exploration and Analysis of Different Visual Odometry Methods

This is the Mobile Robotics Project for Team 1: Fangtong Liu, Matt Wilmes, and Weiyang Zhang

Our master branch is organized into four main folders. These also have their own separate branches if desired:

## cvo-master_3d-visualization_groundtruth-alignment

This folder contains code for the following:
1. The Continuous Direct Sparse Visual Odometry method
2. Tool for aligning calculated data with groundtruth data
3. Our 3D Visualization tool

More information can be seen in the folder's [README.md](https://github.com/mattbwilmes/MobileRoboticsProject/blob/master/cvo-master_3d-visualization_groundtruth-alignment/README.md)


## dvo-master

This folder contains code for our implementation of Dense Visual Odometry

More information can be seen in the folder's [README.md](https://github.com/mattbwilmes/MobileRoboticsProject/blob/master/dvo-master/README.md)


## open3D-master_timestamps_alignment-evaluation

This folder contains code for the following:
1. Open3D's implementation of Direct Visual Odometry and Hybrid Visual Odometry
2. Tools for associating data with regard to timestamps
3. Evaluation tools from TUM to analyze the Relative Pose Error and Absolute Trajectory Error


More information can be seen in the folder's [README.md](https://github.com/mattbwilmes/MobileRoboticsProject/blob/master/open3D-master_timestamps_alignment-evaluation/README.md)


## simple_dvo-master

This folder contains code for running the Simple Dense Visual Odometry method

More information can be seen in the folder's [README.md](https://github.com/mattbwilmes/MobileRoboticsProject/blob/master/simple_dvo-master/README.md)
